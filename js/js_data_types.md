# JavaScript Data Types

## Strings
- strings are text
    - surrounded with quotes - single or double
    - a string that is one character long is still a string, but sometimes we call it a character
    - "The current temperature is 80 degrees" is a string
    - "80" is a string
    - "8" is a string
    - "." is a string
    - "" is a string

## Numbers
- numbers are numbers
  - numbers are things we do math with
  - we use integers (whole numbers) and floating-point numbers (decimals)
  - these are all numbers

## Booleans
- the state of being true or false
- true is a boolean
- "true" no - it is a string
  - sometimes JS can treat these as the same - true and "true"

## null
- null means nothing - purposefully left blank

## undefined
- nothing exists, ????
- typically means that something didn't go according to plan
