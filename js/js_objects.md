# JavaScript Objects
- an object is anything in JS that is not a primitive
  - primitive: one of the base data types (numbers, strings, etc.)

## but more importantly...
- objects are what we know as key-value data structures
- a key has one associated value
- we access that value with the key via square brackets, like we do arrays with indexes
  - ... or we can use dot notation
  - object.key

## arrays vs. objects - the differences
- arrays are ordered, objects are not
  - ... mostly
  - ordered data should be in an array
  - data that benefits from being described should be in an object
- not tchnically a difference, but: arrays contain all the same type data
